Query to NJS product team by Rajesh.B

I am looking for a way to decrypt the request payload (json/xml) where i would have a private key securely stored within Nginx, Its a customer requirement , 
They applied double encryption on the message (RSA 256/AES 256). RSA 256 to decrypt the header where i would have a key to decrypt - using AES256 - the body.


Few inputs from NJS team:

you may find existing JS libraries which would work with njs, but encryption/decryption  usually involves heavy math which means njs is not the best solution here (cannot be used under heavy traffic), because njs is interpreter.
