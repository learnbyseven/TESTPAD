Vulnerability Management 

how ?
Image scanning anchor 



When and Where ?

Application images are building through automation commonly known as CI/CD in agile development methodology
Application images are stationary inside pulic/private container registry 
Application images coexist with their running instances aka containers over the container orchestrator / cloud native platforms

Extended : 
This Image scan not only target vulnerabilities , Its contemplate other important factors
- 
Application images coexist with their running instances aka containers over the container orchestrator / cloud native platforms 


compliance, detection, incident response and forensics in Cloud-native environments

---------
Changes :
- Software is heart of inovation
- Every business is fueled by SW
- High shift from mono ---> distributed 
- Catalyst - Cloud - Container - Container Orchestrator C3
- Key challenges moving from traditional - Modern distributed arch brings a good amout of challenges 
  - Loss of cloud ntive visbility 
  - Nothing static as earlier - Dynamic nd ephermal 
  - Services are first class citizens now 
  - SIEM or tradational tools ad platform may not understand these modern techs and practices 
  
  Val prop :
  - Mend the cloud native visibility gap
  - Lower risk --> reduce cost
  - manage risk, health , performance 
  - 3 x faster in dev-ops adoption transformation or adopting CN techs
  - 95 % reduce risks
  - % increase in efficency 
  
  How SD do devsecops --- 
  
  Devsecops - helps app teams to deliver secure / reliable services / development faster 
  
  Code - Platform - Agile development 
  
  Vul- Mangement:
  Closer to developer 
  Developer pipe line - before it deployed to prod 
  vul free - image build and deployment 
  Maintain Risk and compliance of your Image , @ build @ Stored in registry @ Even images running containers in production 
  
  Image scanning Policies - Enforce control to Block threat 
             Target - Build pipeline
                      Prod env
                      Registry 
             Action : Stop - build process based on policy evaluation 
                      warn 
                      
  Runtime alerting : - Unscanned image deployed 
                     - Vul discovered in prod
                     - Pass and fail results of post image scan 
  Vulnerabilities feed : We keep updating of DB with the latest feed from NVD, OS and Software vendors 
  
  
                      
  
  
  Application Monitoring or observability 
  
  - Single window or pane
  - Multi env or multi cloud
